3. **Save Orders** - Create order record with all details
4. **Save Generated Nutritional Profile** - Store complete nutritional analysis

### High Priority (P1):
5. **Track User Events** - Log key user interactions
6. **Track Smoothie Views** - Record when users view smoothie details
7. **Track Checkout Process** - Monitor conversion funnel

### Medium Priority (P2):
8. **Track Filter Usage** - Understand how users browse
9. **Track Plan Changes** - Monitor 7-day vs 14-day selection
10. **Track Return Visits** - User engagement metrics

## Database Tables Status:

### Already Created (from FIXED_DATABASE_SETUP.sql):
- ✅ `user_profiles`
- ✅ `ingredients`
- ✅ `smoothie_recipes`
- ✅ `orders`
- ✅ `subscriptions`
- ✅ `payment_history`
- ✅ `delivery_partners`

## Business Impact:

### Without This Data:
- ❌ Cannot fulfill orders
- ❌ Cannot track revenue
- ❌ Cannot analyze recipe popularity
- ❌ Cannot improve recommendations
- ❌ Cannot provide customer support (no order history)
- ❌ Cannot send order confirmations
- ❌ Cannot optimize pricing
- ❌ Cannot prove scientific effectiveness

### With This Data:
- ✅ Full order management
- ✅ Revenue tracking and analytics
- ✅ Recipe optimization based on popularity
- ✅ Improved personalization over time
- ✅ Customer order history and support
- ✅ Automated order confirmations
- ✅ Data-driven pricing decisions
- ✅ Scientific validation of recommendations

## Recommended Implementation Order:

1. **Orders** (CRITICAL for business operations)
2. **Smoothie Recipes** (Track what was generated)
3. **User Selections** (Track preferences)
4. **User Events** (Track engagement)
5. **Analytics Dashboard** (View all data)

## Next Steps:

1. Create `DataService` utility for all database operations
2. Update `SmoothieSelection` to save selected smoothies and create order
3. Update `HealthQuestionnaire` to save complete nutritional profile
4. Add event tracking throughout the application
5. Create admin dashboard to view all data
