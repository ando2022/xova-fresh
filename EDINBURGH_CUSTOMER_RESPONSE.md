**Subject: XOVA Personalized Smoothies - Perfect for You!**

Hi [Name],

Thank you so much for your interest in XOVA smoothies! I'm thrilled that you're looking for something more personalized than Huel and SlimFast.

**Great news:** I'm launching XOVA specifically to solve the exact problem you mentioned - creating smoothies that are both **delicious AND nutritious**, tailored to your individual needs and taste preferences.

## What Makes XOVA Different

Unlike mass-produced meal replacements, XOVA creates truly personalized smoothies based on your:
- Health goals and activity level
- Taste preferences (so they're actually delicious!)
- Dietary restrictions and allergies
- Lifestyle and schedule

## Two Options for You

### **Option 1: Personalized Recipe Plan** - 10 CHF
- 7 unique smoothie recipes designed specifically for YOU
- Shopping list for your local Edinburgh supermarkets
- Nutritional breakdown and preparation instructions
- Perfect if you want to source ingredients locally

### **Option 2: Personalized Superfood Mix + Recipe Plan** - 46 CHF
- Everything from Option 1, PLUS:
- **1-month supply** of premium superfood base mix (150g per serving)
- **Personalized blend** customized specifically for YOUR health goals
- High-quality protein, vitamins, minerals, and fiber
- You just add your local fruits & vegetables
- Shipping included (normally 36 CHF)

## Next Steps

1. **Fill out this quick questionnaire** (attached) - takes 5 minutes
2. **Choose your preferred option**
3. **I'll create your personalized smoothie plan** within 24 hours
4. **Start enjoying delicious, nutritious smoothies!**

The questionnaire helps me understand exactly what you need so I can create smoothies that taste amazing and support your health goals.

## Why This Works

Our superfood base mix is a **personalized premium blend** (150g per serving) that I customize for YOU based on your questionnaire:

**Base ingredients:**
- Plant-based protein (25-30g per serving)
- Essential vitamins & minerals
- Prebiotic fiber for digestive health
- Omega-3 fatty acids
- Natural antioxidants

**Plus personalized additions** based on YOUR specific health goals:
- Energy boosters, stress relievers, immune support, or muscle recovery aids
- **No artificial additives or preservatives**

You simply blend 1 serving (150g) with your chosen fruits, vegetables, and liquid - it's that easy!

## Questions?

Feel free to ask me anything about ingredients, shipping to Edinburgh, or how the personalization works. I'm here to make sure you get exactly what you need.

Looking forward to creating your perfect smoothie experience!

Best regards,
Anastasia Dobson
Founder, XOVA
