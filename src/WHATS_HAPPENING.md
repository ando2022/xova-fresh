# ðŸ‘€ What You're Seeing Right Now

## The Setup Screen

When you first load XOVA, you'll see a **Setup Screen** because the app needs to be connected to a Supabase database.

This is **completely normal** and **intentional**. The setup screen will guide you through:

1. Creating a new Supabase project
2. Getting your credentials
3. Pasting them into the code
4. Running the database migration
5. Configuring authentication

## Why am I seeing this?

Your `/lib/supabase.ts` file currently has placeholder values:

```typescript
const supabaseUrl = 'PASTE_YOUR_PROJECT_URL_HERE';
const supabaseAnonKey = 'PASTE_YOUR_ANON_KEY_HERE';
```

The app detects these placeholders and shows you the setup screen instead of trying to connect with invalid credentials.

## What happens after setup?

Once you:
1. âœ… Create a Supabase project
2. âœ… Paste your real credentials into `/lib/supabase.ts`
3. âœ… Save the file
4. âœ… Refresh your browser

The setup screen will **automatically disappear** and you'll see the beautiful XOVA landing page!

## Follow the steps

Just follow the numbered steps on the Setup Screen:
- **Step 1**: Create Supabase project (2 mins)
- **Step 2**: Get credentials (1 min)
- **Step 3**: Paste into code (30 secs)
- **Step 4**: Run migration (1 min)
- **Step 5**: Configure auth (30 secs)

Total time: **~5 minutes**
